# To-Do List App

This is a simple **To-Do List app** built using **SwiftUI** for the user interface, and integrated with **Firebase Firestore** to store tasks and **Firebase Authentication** to handle user login and registration. 
The app allows users to create, manage, and delete their to-do items while being able to securely authenticate via Firebase.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication.
- **Create Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Read Tasks**: The app fetches tasks from Firebase Firestore and displays them in a list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks that they no longer need.
- **User-specific Data**: Each user sees their own to-do list after authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: Declarative framework for building the app's user interface.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Used for user authentication (sign up, sign in, and sign out).
- **Firebase Firestore**: Cloud database to store and manage the to-do list data.
